To start qh download:
node dl.js

The plan was to use couchdb, but mongodb seems simpler to setup and use.

I tried using cofeescript, but I find it hard to read. I prefer JS.
Dealing with node.io is hard enough (limited documentation and examples).
node.js also makes things complicated for a task like this, where things
would be easier in a synchronous way.

I have installed phpmyadmin, set user and password, migrated database.

Completed migrating first part of php (download of all session links
and linked html pages).

TO DO: 
	Migration, from line 170+: tables iniciativa and votacion.
	Make it run regularly.
	When it runs, send report by e-mail.
